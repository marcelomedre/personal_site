Some projects I have been working on for fun or for business. 
  

## [Modeling](http://rpubs.com/marcelomedre/299895)

A study with the `Churn` data set of the `C50 package`.   
  - Data was analysed.  
  - Fators affecting the terminations were explored.   
  - Correlation among variables.  
  - Future terminations were modeled with:
    * glm  
    * Decision Tree  
    * SVM
  - Models were compared using the AUC method.
